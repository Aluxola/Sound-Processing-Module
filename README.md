# Sound Processing Module (SPM) on FPGA

This project presents a **Sound Processing Module (SPM)** implemented using **Verilog HDL** and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado** and **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**. The SPM performs **real-time minimum and maximum amplitude extraction** from 16-bit signed audio signals and applies **statistical filtering** on segmented intervals. This system is designed for applications such as **noise reduction**, **peak detection**, **dynamic range control**, and **loudspeaker protection**.

## üìå Project Overview

The Sound Processing Module consists of two main functional sections:

### 1. **Min-Max Amplitude Detector**
- Continuously calculates the global minimum and maximum amplitudes of an incoming audio stream.
- Implemented as a finite state machine (FSM) with efficient sequential comparison logic.

### 2. **Interval-Based Min-Max Amplitude Detector**
- Segments the audio stream into predefined intervals (e.g., 1s = 44,100 samples).
- Computes min/max values for each interval.
- Applies statistical filtering using standard deviation to remove outliers.

## üß† Background and Applications

This project supports real-world audio processing tasks such as:

- **Impulsive Noise Reduction:** Removing clicks, pops, and transients using min/max filters.
- **Speech and Music Analysis:** Identifying peaks and low-energy regions.
- **Hardware Protection:** Preventing speaker damage from amplitude spikes.
